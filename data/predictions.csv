"""IT'S A BIG CLUB, AND YOU AIN'T IN IT!"" ~ George Carlin

Senate President: ""-- Asked why he couldn’t pay for his own meals, Meyer responded: “We could.”
“I don’t know if that’s common practice — maybe some of the legislators do,” he said.""

Lobbyists reported buying several meals for Meyer over the course of this year’s legislative session. Jerry Mackie, a former legislator whose clients include the state optometrists association, Arctic Slope Regional Corp., Donlin Gold and Alyeska Pipeline Service Corp., spent $535 in March on a dinner for Meyer and five legislative staff — four of whom are Meyer’s aides.

""Meyer said that the idea that lawmakers should pay for their own meals when they dine with lobbyists is a “topic worth discussion.” But the very idea seemed to perplex him.
“We could pay for our own way,” he said. “I’m just trying to think how that would work.”

3) The laws regarding storage facilities are quite different and specific.  They involve notifications, ""over-locks"" and a defined time line until the landlord is vested with ""ownership"" of stored property.

"So the fools that voted to unconstitutionally give away our oil AND pay Big Oil $700 million per year want to take your dividends because the people of Alaska do not buy these clowns fancy dinners.

Here is how we could radically reduce the deficit.

Eliminate corporate welfare.  That would save at least $700 million dollars per year.

Eliminate corporate welfare for Tesoro, Petrostar and Flint Hills, that saves another $50 million per year.

Eliminate the legislatures' annual sessions (and reduce the number of legislative staffers)- let the legislature meet once every two years.  Save another $50 million per year.

Do NOT buy the Tajmahawker, save $32 million.

"The list of mistakes made in the Middle East is very long.  

 Let's face it, in our lifetime, the concerns for Middle Eastern foundational structures (church, state, family, education), has always been secondary to our national interest in oil.   Money bought political power in both regions, and it destroyed much hope for anything but elitist authoritarian regimes(fed by Western money).

It should be no surprise that the hypocrisy of past policy is seen clearly by those who live in these nations.

The O&C Counties successfully sued before and the draft RMP does not come close to meeting the terms of the previous court order so the only way to get the BLM to adhere to previous court decisions is to take them back into court unfortunately.

Flotsam crab - Planes spp.  The rare pelagic crab

In Oregon, there are not many crabs living anywhere but the bottom of the sea or estuary. Flotsam crabs are the exception.
Two species are found in Oregon: Planes major (formerly P. cyaneus) and Planes marinus. Both species is known for living on floating debris (flotsam), derelict fishing gear, and even upon live animals (e.g. sea turtles).
When found it is often by those looking for glass floats, which these crab often live on, needless to say, Planes crab are a rare find.

aka. Columbus crab - Planes spp.

The species Planes marinus is by far rarer of the two species found in the Pacific Northwest (G. Jensen, pers comm.) This genus of crab is also referred to as ""Columbus crabs""

You need to articulate better than to suggest a bias opinion. You staunchly opposed Bush in agreement with William F Buckley who warned the GOP they were committing political suicide. Glad to hear. I read the piece. Unfortunately, the Right let Trump play pit bull then he turned on them. Now what to do? Break the rules of the convention or face a destroyer of the Empire?

"The problem with Alaska is that it has extremely high costs of health care, and then those high costs have to be spread over the small number of people who buy insurance through the healthcare.gov marketplace.  Premera has said that a just a handful of high-cost patients has driven up the cost for everybody else; that immediately indicates that the pool of patients is too small.

So many people in Alaska get their insurance through the government, either federal, state, or military.  Wouldn't it be great if those of us who have to buy health insurance through the marketplace could instead enroll in one of these government programs?  The more patients join together in larger and larger patient pools, the better the leverage to drive down the cost of health care.",0,0,0.022809770135291254,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,771

"Having lived where traffic law enforcement was the norm, I can say that it is entirely possible that zero-tolerance traffic law enforcement may well have prevented this crash. If no one else was speeding, then this loser would have stuck out like a sore thumb with his poor driving skills and could have been pulled over prior to colliding with the tree and other car. 

When traffic laws are enforced many, many criminals are caught because criminals just can't help but drive like criminals. The rest of us generally learn to obey the law when it is enforced. Even if traffic law enforcement didn't prevent this one incident, it would prevent countless other crashes as our drunks and chronic poor drivers either cleaned up their acts or lost their driving privilege/were incarcerated.

"Thanks to the decades of lies from Big Pharma including that some of the narcotics weren't really narcs ( I heard it from their mouths) millions who trusted ill-informed and in some cases con artisty doctors and became addicted, then later the doctors just cut them off without help, so they turned to cheap heroin. It's all about taking control of your health yourself, there are amazing dietary tools, food is medicine and that includes spices, herbs and teas. Lots of pain is caused by inflammation, sugar causes it (so do legumes) and eating certain foods decreases it. Narcotics make many types of pain get worse such as migraines and fibromyalgia. Exercise helps and sleep is a very powerful inflammation reducer. That inflammation from sugar is causing other health problems too such as heart disease. There are non-narcotic meds.

"It is really hilarious how the backers of these bills and the Register Guard both so staunchly insist that these bills are exactly what the people want, stating that to be an actual fact.  Yet, both of these bills had the infamous ""emergency"" clause in them, which basically blocks the right of the people under Oregon's Constitution to ask for a referendum before it becomes law.

If these bills really are what the people want, then why deliberately block the right of the people to be able to vote to approve them??   That is an abuse of Oregon's Constitution, and undermines the checks and balances in it.

That seems most inconsistent and hypocritical to me.

Since the oil production is on AK land owned/possessed by the residents, tribes, and AK government as landlords, the oil companies shouldn't be asking for compensation for utilizing AK land/soil. It should be the other way around!

"What you have with guns and suicidal individuals is a combination that ups the likelihood of death.  

First off, self-inflicted gunshot wounds are the most effective ways of killing oneself.  A Harvard study from 2001 found that 85% of those who attempted suicide this way were successful.  Suffocation (hanging) came in second at 69%.  All other methods were well below 50%.

Second the availability of guns increases the likelihood of attempting suicide.  It's quick and requires little pre-planning.  Guns play an outsized role in spontaneous suicides.  Someone in a momentary crisis situation with a tendency toward depression and perhaps under the influence of alcohol or drugs grabs a gun and it's over.  A noose requires work,  other means lead to prolonged periods between initiating the attempt and death, which gives time for an intervention or for the suicidal person to seek help.

2/3 of our gun deaths are suicides.  It's not anti-gun to acknowledge this and seek to fix it.",0,0,0.3213471732230288,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,989

BREAKING NEWS:

    In response to a proposal to move the Legislative Office Building to Spenard, an emergency Spenard Community meeting was held last evening.  In attendance were bar owners, adult bookstore owners, hookers, strippers, drunken musicians, prospective marijuana store owners and after-hours gambling entrepreneurs.  
     At the conclusion of the meeting, the group voted unanimously to oppose the relocation of the Legislative Offices to a former bank building in Spenard. 
    A spokesman said, “We’re concerned that if the Legislature moves to Spenard, it will give our neighborhood a bad name and ruin our reputation.”

That is unless you are one of the citizens who would pay no income tax. Forty percent or more of the residents do not pay a federal income tax & would not have to pay a state income tax. That is wrong. The bills of the state are owned by everybody who lives here, not just a targeted group of people.
I support a flat sales tax and a system of users fees where everyone pays the bills of the state. The more you buy, the more you pay. Under an income tax, those who paid no tax would not care what the bills of the state were and would not care about voting for politicians who showed restraint with spending taxpayer money.

"Aggregate demand increases with an increase in wage.  Since inflation on an aggregate level is around .04% with an increase in minimum wage, the benefit of the increased wages go directly into consumption because most low income earners have a high marginal propensity to consume.  That means they spend nearly all the income they earn and it flows back into the economy.  That compares to a working with low MPC (a doctor for example) that with an increase in income, the amount that flow back into the economy directly is only proportionate to what they are willing to spend and not the amount they are saving or investing.   In other words, if you increase wages at the bottom it flows back to the top offsetting the additional costs in the long run.

"Right Tim, 
The state of Alaska's financial woes should be blamed squarely on people needing rescue. It certainly has nothing to do with decades of regressive fiscal policies like pretending high oil revenues were eternal, relying on federal subsidies instead of a state income tax, and general squandering of money on personal pet projects. But hey, at least you get to collect your PFD each year! Where did all the revenue go from the years of $120/barrel oil? Must have been wasted on rescues? 
Oh by the way, the rescue was ultimately performed by the NPS, not the Air National Guard, and in any case, the cost of such rescues, whether they are performed by the NPS or the Guard, comes out of the national SAR account, which covers rescue costs for everyone from mountain climbers to snowmachiners to fisherman to lost children on trails. State of Alaska doesn't foot the bill in this case. On the big scale, this rescue might have cost you about 4 cents, so your rage is certainly justified.",0,0,0.06238120563937241,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,996

"I grew up in Anchorage in the late 1950s and 1960s. Homophobia was systemic and ugly. Gay men had to hide behind fake relationships/marriages with women. Getting fired for being gay was a sport. When the oil patch right-wing gay haters invaded in the 1970s, the dominionists among them gained power and turned the state into a pathetic version of Oklahoma with mountains.

Alaska politicians (until the Honorable Mayor Berkowitz), like most GOPtp folks, pander to the haters.

"""The cheapest and most certain way to reduce murder is the death penalty for murderers.""  

I dispute this assertion vigorously.  Simple reason.  Most murders are committed by people who only offend once.  Yes, there are some serial killers, but most murders are from rage or circumstance that does not recur.  Other crimes are like this as well.  Commission of most crimes is by first time offenders.  The notion that killing offenders will reduce crime is largely without factual basis - it just feels good.

Teaching that human life can be forfeit on the false premise that it reduces crime, in my opinion, creates the very atmosphere wherein individuals are prone to take life.  Teach the taking of life and individuals will learn.

"While I am in agreement with the need to keep the officer and his/her family safe, this is not the way to do it. When police activities of any sort, let alone a shooting where someone dies, are allowed to be kept secret from public review, we risk abuse and tyranny. While it may seem prudent right now in this particular case, eventually a law like this in the hands of those who are entrusted with police power tends to become standard procedure. Once that happens abuse of the practice is certain to follow, and should it become widespread it becomes tyranny. It is a slippery slope.

Anyone who becomes a police officer knows what they sign up for when they take the job. Since this kind of thing happens rarely, the officer's name should still be released, but the officer and family should be protected as needed by moving them somewhere secure until the threat is sufficiently reduced.

Dr C.L.Russell of CMA: ""The non ionizing microwave radiation from wi fi routers, ipads, cell phones and cell towers has been thought to be harmless until the last few decades as a rapidly growing body of peer reviewed research has shown very troubling biological and health effects from even low levels of exposure. The studies have shown negative effects on cell structures, brain function, animals, and plants. Many experts feel this is a looming public health problem as the use of wireless technology swiftly rises in our homes, offices and schools. EMF standards need to be reevalauted and designed for safety based on the biologic effects on living structures not on heat as is now currently being done.""

He is mostly spending his own money rather than taking it from special interests. Also good. He has been vastly successful in business in this country and around the world. Good.

Last year we had a bizarre experience in the same grey area.  My crew joined my SIL, niece and dogs for a walk.  The dogs were unleashed and under voice-control.  She and I had looped a pond by a school and were approaching the playground, where my kids & hubby were playing. Both dogs were ten feet in front of us.  A man at the playground stepped out and smacked one dog with a ski pole and began screaming at us about leash laws.  She recalled her dogs, who sat at her side while the man continued to brandish the pole and scream. My Popeye-esque husband hustled over and his presence caused the man to lower his voice and his pole. We promptly left.

The laws need clarification before someone gets hurt.

"Ms. Spitz's comments reflect little understanding of toy collecting. There is nothing sexist or ageist about the hobby, or Mr. McClafferty. Admittedly, toy collectors are predominantly male and easily make up 90%+ of the hobby. But don't  jump to conclusions based on a simple statistic. 
Girls, and women, simply prefer to spend their money on things other than toys, and when it comes to matters economic, they tend to be much more pragmatic....say, opting to make that car payment before engaging in discretionary spending. That way, any loving girlfriend can drive her man to the show, where he can blow the paycheck on old Star Wars toys....
But that doesn't make collecting a sexist avocation. 
In fact, Mr. McClafferty's toy shows are very inviting to both genders and all age groups: it's a family affair.

In Utah, campus rape increased nearly 50 percent between 2012 and 2013. By contrast, sexual assaults nationwide have been decreasing each year by approximately 3 percent.

Maybe they should have planned the overall system first, to avoid the apparent crisscrossing on the five block sections of Chambers and Garfield.  West 11th should be feed by 13th/11th, but the city council rejected that alternative several years ago; setting-up an appearance of halves of two different routes.

Your pastor does.  Take some responsibility for attending a church whose take on the bible is both mushy and offensive.   The Conservative Baptist churches like Imago Dei actively oppose civil rights for gays,  They pick and choose people to condemn, without rhyme or reason, from the Bible.

Here's the answer: because the role of the state in a democracy, however mediocre and dysfunctional the institutions of that democracy might be, is to promote the welfare of the general public. Voting is a public good. Automatically registering citizens to vote does no harm. The state should make it as easy as possible for citizens to participate in elections. As citizens participate more, they will see the wisdom of informing themselves on the issues. This is exactly what anti-voting rights people fear.
That people actually have a problem with making it easier for citizens to vote is a measure of the backward mentalites--extreme individualism, laissez-faire racism, anti-government paranoia--that prevail here and prevent American society from moving into the 21st century.",0,0,0.08405240203824263,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,979

Remember this. The Arctic Ocean has not been ice free for 2.5 million years. The only Arctic Ocean we have even known as humans had a layer of ice keeping it flat when the wind howls. With no ice this ocean will get swells. Really big wind driven swells and they will severely erode  all of the surrounding shores which we have see in only small ways so far. Of course the sea level will be much higher too. It will become the most dangerous and destructive ocean on the planet.

"I share your concern (ms.amylou).  But the article says they gave the concept some consideration when they set limits on consumption and forbade lingering after consumption.  I don't think that sounds very practical, however.

It seems unlikely anyone will be actually enforcing the rules on a continuous basis.

"Hi Cydney. The 60's were very different for me. My family had moved to a much bigger town and larger school district. My elementary and intermediate years were done in a small 2 room school One teacher taught 1-4th grade and the other taught 5th-8th grade. Our bus driver was our music, PE and art teacher, so it was like a big family. The kids in the 4th grade and 8th grade, became assistant instructors and help the younger kids out, so the teacher never had to stop the lessons. It worked very well, not to mention it helped create a sense of citizenship and community. We can never go back to those days and I'm sure glad I don't have to attend the schools we have today. There are some lessons to learn from those times but education today doesn't understand the concept nor do they have a base for such perception. It can't be fixed but I feel bad for the youngsters now days.

*It was the last precept, though, that pushed Bailey from the church for about a year in 2011. ...*

*He returned after numerous conversations with elders led him to believe there was room for his beliefs in the church, he says.*

The proof that such a condition of affairs exists in some localities is now before the Senate.

"Aikens history went from the Paiutes to the arrival of settlers in the 1840's bypassing the trapping period from 1810-40. A relative of mine, Louis Pichette, trapped the region for Hudson's Bay Co. He was the first Euro-American in Northeast CA (1820). 

The Paiutes were considered to be more primitive than many other tribes in the Oregon Territory. This was because of their transitory camps and desire to avoid contact. Resources were scarce with little surplus. They rarely traded but raiding was an honored practice. 

What ties the op-ed and its comments together is the different rate of exploitation practiced by natives and Euro-Americans. The trappers were a bridge. Over-harvesting the regions fur bearers infuriated the Paiutes. 

A Marxist interpretation adds to this thesis. Capitalism ramps up the rate of resource  extraction and often leads to systemic degradation. This is the Euro-American legacy.  The opinions here reflect different views on its value.",0,0,0.11527217864752856,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,974

General Electric, Boeing, Verizon and 23 other profitable Fortune 500 firms paid no federal income taxes from 2008 to 2012.

"Rachael Stevenson,
Your wish has already been granted and has been since 1983 when the portion of Alaska lying in the former Alaska Time Zone permanently advanced clocks one hour.  If you live in Anchorage you are on DST year-round and on ""double DST"" now.   Areas to the West in the former Bering Time Zone advanced clocks two hours permanently in 1983 and today they are on ""triple daylight saving time.  The ""winners"" in 1983 were the people in Southeast who permanent turned back clocks one hour and returned to the former Yukon Time Zone where the time of day and position of the Sun coincide.  However, they are now the biggest ""whiners"" because they want to return to the Pacific Time Zone where they were from WWII to 1983.    I have pointed out that if position of the Sun and time of day mean anything, we in most of Alaska have done enough.

....in late 2014, federal lawmakers responded to the dilemma in another way: They made it possible to cut retiree benefits. The Multiemployer Pension Reform Act, tucked into a huge omnibus spending bill and passed without public hearings or debate, set up a mechanism through which pension trustees could propose a plan to reduce monthly payments. Backed by a coalition of pension plan trustees, unions, and employers, this approach will stretch the dwindling assets of troubled funds further into the future. But for retirees, most of whom knew little or nothing about the change in law as it was happening, it means benefits they earned could go up in smoke.

"I hope there's a video recording posted of the April 12 Ward 1 candidates' forum that the JWN and LWV sponsored.
 
Chris Wig was hilarious. I felt I was watching a Saturday Night Live actor impersonate a pompous local politician in a two-bit town.
 
The ""punch line"" came when Wig gave his closing statement as a discourse on what it mean to be ""progressive,"" puffing up his final act with references to the Knights of Labor fights with the Pinkerton goons.

Wig wrote an idiotic, insulting and inflammatory letter to Council after the 5-3 vote in favor of a motion by Councilor Clark to protect the R-1, single-family neighborhoods. He's no friend of neighborhoods.

Wig is more interested in seeing himself as a heroic savior of the unwashed than listening to his ward constituents' concerns.

""If Republicans focus on what government should be doing, which governments should be doing it, and how to do it effectively and efficiently, voters will listen and the Republican brand will become more appealing.""

It's a theme that I've tried to promote for about a decade now.   Any stable nation state has a strong government structure - no government is not an option.

"Thanks Rep. Gara.  You've always been an articulate advocate for Alaska on this issue.

We have a system so corrupt, so blatantly in violation of the Alaska Constitution that we have several choices.

1.  We must overthrow the corrupt legislature this November.  In a perfect world those who have sabotaged Alaska so badly should be jailed.

2.  We can go to court and have this unconstitutional theft overturned by a judge. $20 million dollars of oil is taken from Alaska every day- that is $140 million per week.  A judge could employ several remedies up to and including shutting down the pipeline.  Our oil is finite, better to stop the flow and get the money later than to just give away massive wealth.

3.  We can appeal to the Conoco caucus to stop this theft... only kidding, asking them to stop this theft would be like asking a child molester to stop abusing children.  (Like Pete Kelly's son.)",0,1,0.6810335907081357,0,0.1666666716337204,0.0,0.0,0.1666666716337204,0.0,0.0,0.1666666716337204,905

And FWIW your are correct that the response time clock for first responders begins ticking when the call is answered.

911 call handling and dispatch is tracked differently.

I think NAFPA says medical and fire calls are to be dispatched within 60 seconds of picking up the phone 90 percent of the time.  This is a lot quicker than having just a 60 second average. 

Then a tougher time standard kicks in,, first responders are supposed to be enroute within 6o seconds of the alarm activating.  Fire misses this standard a bit,, AMR which tends to have crews standing-by in their rigs, is in compliance.

AMR gets fined not being in compliance,,,nothing happens to Fire.

People weren't happy.  Some left the company because the career advancements achieved so far disappeared.  They found jobs elsewhere.  But most stayed.

If her supervisor comes up with the line that defends her free-range, earth-friendly snobbery was ""a joke"", there's no reason to talk to anyone at the school about this assignment (clearly the entire administration sees the mind-numbing cognitive dissonance in labeling a cake full of sugar ""earth friendly"" and ""cruelty free""). Leak it to the WW, and see what happens: Lo and behold, suddenly the creativity-loving food snob changes her tune.

There's nothing wrong with advocating for creativity (though I personally am skeptical of elementary school creativity proselytizers). There's absolutely nothing wrong with using and advocating ""earth friendly"" and ""human healthy"" ingredients.  But a middle school teacher - even one who lives in Portland - has no credentials to know what these ingredients are, and no right to push parents of her students to make financial lifestyle decisions based on the teacher's personal moral stance on branding and labeling of chicken and wheat products. In any case, she's recommending they make cakes out of cookie or brownie or cake batters. The number 1 or 2 ingredient is going to be some form of sugar, which is probably the worst thing you could eat, health-wise, and ""plantation-consciousness""-wise, anyway.",0,0,0.1822556524626959,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1737

"Follow the legal reasoning. Per the law, to use a firearm against another person, even just to threaten, is to use deadly force. Even if you don't actually fire, you have still used deadly force.

The use of deadly force in self-defense is only legally justified if the threat you are defending against is also a deadly force threat, armed or not. So, if you state you felt a deliberate shot to the leg (which can easily kill or maim regardless) was ""sufficient"" to stop a threat, almost by definition you did not feel that threat was actually serious enough to justify using the gun at all. If you didn't think the attack constituted a threat of death or grievous bodily harm, why were you shooting?

Firearms cannot, by law, be used as ""less lethal"" defensive weapons to ensure compliance or to counter non-lethal threats, regardless of your intent. If they aren't threatening your life, you don't even threaten with a gun, much less shoot. If they are, you shoot to stop, not to wound.",0,1,0.6261670448255315,0,0.1666666716337204,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,988

This decision by the Alaska Supreme Court combined cases in Kenai and Anchorage where the former tried to keep city manager applications from the public, and the latter tried to keep police chief applications from the public.  Newspapers, including the Anchorage Daily News, sued, and won.

The Court affirmed Superior Court decisions that: (a) concluded that applications were public records and that the deliberations of the Kenai city council concerning appointment of a city manager must be held in public meetings. The court thereupon ordered the city to permit the inspection and copying of the applications and to refrain from any closed deliberations concerning the selection of the new city manager.

"“Beautiful and meaningful” are all in the eyes of the beholder.

Whether tattoos, piercings, hairstyles/colors, or wardrobe … in most jobs you’re part of a team, and there is no “I” in team. Leave the bling home, or cover it up (not every tattoo is “bling” but an employer has a right to determine where to draw the line).

Those numbers are percentages, not based on total numbers. No woman who goes to a clinic gets either type of abortion with no screening. The women who do get abortions without medical screening are women who get illegal abortions, which is what women do in places abortion isn't available. These laws have nothing to do with safety.

"Ojan from PAX Labs here. We appreciate the shout-out!  I thought I'd chime with a few tips from our PAX Pros. First, I have to say disassembling your pods could cause them to leak into the device which would void the warranty. Just putting that out there.

For our PAX 2, it requires minimal cleaning compared to the original device - once per week at most, or twice a month depending on your usage - and no more mouthpiece lubricant (yay).

We suggest cycling through the 4 temp settings, 360f to 420f, as your session progresses so you get the most out of your loose-leaf. Also with lip sensing tech, a redesigned oven, and more efficient heating, a full charge can last 5-10 sessions depending on usage before needing to recharge via USB, or with our AC adapter.

And don't forget about our 10 year warranty, backed by the PAX Pro's.  We know it's an investment and will stand behind it.

""The fact that Sanders’ ethical platform does, in fact, result in economic gains shouldn’t be surprising. Empirical evidence shows that the 3 times we’ve adopted a laisez-fair approach to regulating the economy, it has resulted in extreme income inequality leading inevitably to the 3 biggest economic disruptions in US history: the Depression in 1890’s, the Great Depression in 1930’s, and the Great Recession in 2008. This shouldn’t be particularly surprising. When most of the consumers in a consumer economy don’t have much in the way of expendable income, there isn’t enough demand to sustain growth.

Alaskans and smaller competitors can’t drill and profit because the laws are too harsh and the system is rigged. It is time to fix it and prosper with more royalty income!

Alaska has the oil wealth but it is locked up with bad rules and the majors monopoly, it is time to give Alaska back now!!

Alaskans can’t drill and profit under these current laws, that is why not one Alaskan has ever been able to drill and sell oil at a profit but many can’t realize the issues, why?

First of all, the last DOT cost estimate for the project, which is already obsolete, was $574 million, not the $552 million in the op-ed.  $22 million may be chump change to some, but not to me.

Second, at one time during the project ""planning,"" the cost of ferries dedicated to run between the end of the new road and Haines and Skagway were appropriately included in the project costs.  Then, when the Alaska Class ferry was initially designed to be able to serve the entire AMHS service area, the ferry costs were deleted. Then a re-design occurred, and the new ferries will be Juneau Access day boats only; their costs have never been added back to the project, however.

I don't see much strategic focus here, specific to student success outcomes.
Quite simply, when students = revenue (which they do) and the students pay for an education with the goal of sustained employment upon graduation and that doesn't happen, students cease to enroll. Then revenues decrease.

Walker wants to sell that to Tesoro.  According to the ADN article, the state will pay out $825 million in secret tax credits (cash) to the oil companies, leaving you and me to pick up the deficit.

"""The creation of a new international bureaucracy with the power to regulate the oceans was repellent to Reagan because he knew it would be used to favor the underdeveloped world at the expense of industrialized countries.

"The generally negative comments to this excellent piece are an indication of how spot on it is.  I remember when Jay Hammond was governor there was always some group of constituents who were upset with him - fisherman, guides, miners, oil company people, etc.  The reason was that Hammond worked very hard to serve the best interests of the State of Alaska, which he loved, and was not overly concerned about his popularity with any specific interest group.  There is universal agreement that we need to cut spending, so lets take that as a given.  It is a fact,however, not open to debate, that we cannot solve the state budget crisis with cuts alone.  I believe there is no better way to facilitate fair, effective budget cuts than to implement the taxes outlined by Mr. Rasmussen, which will affect nearly every Alaskan, and increase scrutiny of spending, the legislative process, and perhaps help us elect legislators capable of responding not just to their constituents, but to reality also.",0,0,0.029928188833624456,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,996

"So how big of a sales tax would be required?  Juneau has a 5% sales tax and brings in $43 million spread across about 30,000 residents.  Expand that to the entire state and that brings in about $1 billion.  But it has a few problems:
1.  Juneau gets a million cruise tourists a year, so sales tax revenue is likely higher there than it would be elsewhere.  In reality the state sales tax would need to be 6% or more.
2.  Many out-of-state owned businesses skip town without remitting their taxes.  Difficult to enforce when the business is operating in the Virgin Islands or whatever winter cruise port.  It's a perennial problem there.
3.  A state sales tax would be piled on top of existing municipal sales taxes in the communities that have them (i.e. Juneau would have a 10% sales tax).  So they would have to switch to higher property taxes which the sales tax supporters would probably consider even less fair.

One might assume that as school enrollment, course offerings, and test scores decrease, appropriate funding would be provided to resolve such issues; however, this is not reality. As schools suffer, funding dwindles, leading to further issues. 

Most low-income families from the NEHS area do not have the time, money, or resources to transfer their children to other schools, thus are limited in their options. Families with such resources however do, and they choose their schools accordingly. This ongoing cycle of economically secure families transferring their children away from NEHS leaves only families suffering from socio-economic disparity. We see the same cycle all over the US. It's social-choice segregation, which, in turn, leaves schools like NEHS underfunded, understaffed, with a greater population of lower-income student.

"What is crazy is to tie shootings with gun collectors. It is illegal to discharge a firearm inside the city except on a firing range or when necessity applies. Even then, it may be unwise or irresponsible to shoot (because most bullets miss the intended target but ALWAYS hit someone or something: if not the intended target, than an unintended one). Statistical evidence is that misconduct (or legal but unwise use) of firearms is almost never associated with collections - the typical collector’s piece is never discharged (and loses value if it is used and worn). The path to “put a dent in these shootings” surely lies in figuring out how to deter or prevent them in the first place? My suggestion is to advocate both civic and firearms education.

"Re: Gender identity and discrimination. Basically I agree with Thomas Morse that some religions aggravate discrimination and it is wrong to do so. However, I would raise an issue regarding the clarity of how it is determined that ""you is or you aint"" in any given category. As with cataloguing any trait (religious belief, interest in fishing, or even sexual identification) characteristics are seldom YES or NO. Rather, reality presents a wide continuum of incremental differences - which might even change over time for one individual.

Apparatus at birth can be misleading. Shifts in sexual orientation might possibly be genetic, hormonal, medical, or even arising from educational or philosophical changes. Perhaps there are actually lesser or greater variations of bi-sexuality which permeate all human beings, but which are currently not measured. Humans travel the world and have extensive genetic mixing - as different from the more closed populations of other animals.

Without even getting into general relativity, it was clear that a suitably massive star simply could not by any known force avoid collapse to a singularity when no longer able to generate fusion power.  Also, Newton was essentially silent on gravity waves dealing rather with relatively stationary bodies.  If Isenberg had asked Newton what would happen if the sun were displaced by million miles in 10 seconds, I suspect Newton would have paused and speculated on a gravitational field distortion at large distances from the Sun that resembles gravitational waves.  Of course, we cannot ask Newton, but the point is that the analogy between the emission of electromagnetic (light) and gravitational waves is not so incredibly different.

They are judicially created methods. The first is for the States to pass a general cession statute. ... The second method is for the federal government to reserve jurisdiction at the time statehood is granted to a territory. This does not involve a transfer of legislative jurisdiction because the State never had jurisdiction over the land in the first place. This is how the federal government gained control over so much property in the western United States.""

Last month we paid back $9,210 for coverage we did not want, could not afford, and could not use, all because we thought we should comply with the law. We couldn’t use it because the deductibles were so high. We had Moda’s bronze plan.

We are a couple in our 60s adjusting to a drastic lifestyle change from rural semi-self-sufficient to urban. Our Obamacare premiums were double our monthly housing payments.

I believe a common thread among agencies and Commissioners was best expressed by a commissioner at a meeting I attended. The commissioner in the past had stated repeatedly ""we need to get politics and emotion out of decisions, and use science."" Anyhow, following a presentation by state biologists that showed current cougar hunting was detrimental to people and to cougars, he said, ""well science is fine, but we have to use common sense.""

"By voting against the school bonds, I hope the city and school district get one message, that is, you should not bond for items that are maintenance.  When you build a school, you may construct it to last 50 years, but there are certain things that will need to be replaced well before the 50 year life ends.  Boilers, roofs etc.  These items should be budgeted for through the use of a sinking fund, not a bond.  Each year there should be a portion of the ASD operating budget set aside for building repair and maintenance and when the time comes to repair or replace a boiler or roof, the money is there.  Rather than pay interest on a bond, you could actually earn interest through investing the set aside in safe holding accounts.

"""People are not going to stop moving to Portland, so the big question is how to meed demand.""

Statements like this exemplify a glaring blind spot in so much free-market-fundamentalist thinking and discussion about Portland's housing crisis.  

It's simply not true that the only control citizens have over the problems of immigration and housing are ""supply"" and ""demand,"" and that all else is decided by the unregulable, un-blame-able marketplace.  Our current growth rate, good or bad, is the result of concerted effort by our elected officials and planners.  As it turns out, they benefit from growth a lot more than the rest of us.

What, where and how much Portland chooses to grow has a tremendous effect on how many people move here and who they are.  The vast majority of Portlanders are deeply alienated by the current rate of change, and that's not a problem we can solve by building faster.  There are other, better solutions to this crisis.

If Alaskans want massive lay offs and TAPS shutting down and Alaska going broke then pass HB 247, simple.

The oil Industry has found billions of barrels of oil under the current program so why change it when oil prices are so low, one would have to be a fool to hurt the state now.

This action of killing the smaller oil and gas investors will hurt every Alaskan for years to come.

Don't tell the world of oil and gas investors Alaska is not open for business by passing any part of HB 247.",0,0,0.09880043834753932,1,0.20000000298023224,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20000000298023224,0.0,0.0,914
They just want to break it so they can justify forced privitization.  Just defuned it so it can't function properly. Oh look its obsolete. The government cant run anything properly. We have to privatize. You know add profit to someone else into the cost. That always makes things cost less. Then when we can't afford their private services we'll all be part of the growing loser/user class. No matter how well something functions the greedy will suck every thing they can out of it and claim victory at making services available to the elite and it's our fault we can't afford to use our own postal service. Comment is heavy on sarcasm. Yes more privitization to keep the cost down. I'm just not buying it.,0,0,0.2972566538569429,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,706

"Skepticism is the wise course, but when that skepticism directly discounts mountains of evidence and data that shows that since the industrial revolution the rate of climate change has grown exponentially is not skepticism but is nothing more than denial of facts in the guise of skepticism. 

When the majority of independent and independently produced research agrees with and supports the thesis that climate change is being directly affected by the actions of man, then one has to at least grant that there is a strong possibility that the thesis is correct.

The deniers posing as skeptics fall back on prejudiced research, logical fallacies, and, unfortunately, often name calling to advance their argument while ignoring anything that reeks of intellectualism - We have become a society wherein it is often branded a sin to be learned or willing to question one's own beliefs and intelligences.

"Today the use, sale and possession of cannabis (marijuana) in the United States remains illegal under federal law. However, some states have created exemptions for various uses, mainly medical. In four states, Alaska, Colorado, Oregon and Washington, the sale and possession of marijuana is legal for both medical and non-medical use; and Washington DC has legalized personal use but not commercial sale.[2] Multiple efforts to reschedule cannabis under the Controlled Substances Act have failed, and the United States Supreme Court has ruled in United States v.

"TimBerry,
I think you've got a couple things wrong. ""...the court was brilliantly conceived to interpret the text to keep up with changes,"" and ""the constitution allowed slavery and only male property holders could vote.""
In both examples, the changes were effected via amendments; the 13th prohibited slavery and the 19th provided universal suffrage. No ""interpretation"" on the part of any court was needed.
In my opinion, constitutional interpretation is a slippery slope. After all, anyone, including a judge, can interpret any constitutional clause any way he or she wants even if totally detached from logic and reality. (Perhaps we've seen this?)
Rather, Judge Scalia's tenets of texturalism and originalism are what's needed; close adherence to the original meaning and intent of the Constitution.

"Absolutely agree Christina! Our son's transition from elementary to middle school was very difficult because there was almost no information available to us.  We asked questions about programs and were told the information didn't exist, that it didn't matter anyway because an administrator downtown would decide where he would go to middle school.  I found that so shocking at the time, that we as his parents or even his school team had no say on which middle school he would attend.  When I asked why this person wasn't at the table I was told there was no choice but to ""trust the process"" which included NO information about the programs or schools he could attend.  It is really a shame that the more needs a child has, the less information information there is.  It makes no sense why this information can't be available to all parents with children in special education.

The City has removed sitting areas from the center of ""downtown"" to try to eliminate loitering. The city provides parks and benches for resting a short distance to the east. There is open space in the park blocks for concerts and gatherings that is equal to or has greater square footage available.  3) By returning the square to it's intended use as defined by the term ""downtown"" ...does NOT mean Eugene is uncaring or should feel guilt.

So WE paid for all of this.  And with SB-21 we allow Big Oil to take the oil tax free under the GVR provisions of SB-21 (""new"" oil) for wells drilled as far back as 2001.

"...(continued) have the time and resources to take their students to a school all the way across town. It creates a cycle where as more affluent students transfer to different high schools that are growing and adding staff, we see that less affluent students are stuck in a school that shrinks and suffers.

When you talk about what ""those 310 students think they are getting at South, Churchill, or Sheldon that they aren't getting at North"", you seem to think it's some innate quality that those schools have, which North does not.

It is not.
It is funding.
And it is caused by the exodus of students that the ""School Choice"" policy allows.

And there is a way to address this problem: By deciding, as organizations often do, that the rules of the past simply do not have the effects that we need today.

"There is a very simple solution that would allow non-consumptive users to contribute to state sponsored wildlife education, conservation, and wildlife viewing programs and that is to have a voluntary checkoff on the PFD application. If this were in place, one could contribute as much as one wants from one's PFD. 

But there is a catch, as a non-consumptive user - I would want equal representation on the Board of Game as opposed to the second class status that non-consumptive users currently are relegated to. It is for this reason that while the hunting community may complain about non-hunters not contributing financially, in reality, this is exactly what they want as it helps them to maintain their political monopoly on fish and wildlife resources.

It is easy for politicians to pander to special interest groups, and to obey political pressures put on them by their own Party.

Great politicians, though, are guided by doing what is best for society as a whole.

"I need some myself and plan to get some soon.  I live in an apartment in the Cook Inlet apartment in the woods.  A black bear kept visiting.  The workmen forgot to lock the door to the garbage and I saw the bear running across the lawn just a few yards away with the white plastic bag bouncing along side of him.  There wasn't much in it.  I locked the door.  He came back and tried as he might to pull the door open but couldn't.  Another day there was a man and woman looking at the bear outside my apt and the woman was throwing food to it.  I chased her off.  A few days later I ran into the man and he said he just wanted to see the bear and it was hungry.  Dumb.  I informed him (1) if he wants feed it do it outside his building not mine and (2) if you continue to feed the bear he will die not by starvation, but by being shot.

"""If you want your children to be intelligent, read them fairy tales. If you want them to be more intelligent, read them more fairy tales."" Albert Einstein

""Goldilocks and the Three Bears"" and the older ""The Story of the Three Bears"" are two variations of an old fairy tale. The original tale tells of an ugly, old woman who enters the forest home of three bachelor bears whilst they are away. She sits in their chairs, eats some of their porridge, and falls asleep in one of their beds. When the bears return and discover her, she starts up, jumps from the window, and is never seen again. The other major version brings Goldilocks to the tale (replacing the old woman), and an even later version retained Goldilocks, but has the three bachelor bears transformed into Papa, Mama, and Baby Bear...

"The suggestion to raise the legal age to purchase, possess or use tobacco to 21 in Lane County is, in my opinion, simply a bit of ineffectual political grandstanding.  

Commissioner Bozievich attempts to make the case that raising the age from 18 to 21 will 
be a deterrent to young people ages 18 to 21 and decrease the number of new smokers.  This is a baseless argument.  First, Mr. Bozievich tells us he started smoking at age 15.  I'm guessing whatever state he lived in at age 15 did not allow him to legally purchase, possess and use tobacco.  So that law (again assuming it was in place) had no deterrent effect on him.  He is a personal argument against his contention. 

Additionally, in the Winter edition of the ""Eugene"" quarterly magazine, Smoke Free Oregon runs a full page anti-smoking ad.  It states in large latters ""90% OF SMOKERS STARTED BEFORE AGE 18.""  Raising the age from 18 to 21 will have absolutely no impact on this 90%

"That is a very simple answer : NO

I first visited Oregon 10 years ago - I stayed at my sisters apartment. She warned me about where to not go and what to not do at night because of homeless drunk crack heads.

My second visit was 8 years ago - my wife and I stayed at the Benson hotel - we were harassed while unloading luggage and while walking to the hotel - rental car was keyed, guessing because we didn't hand any cash to the beggars.

Fast forward to living in oregon - We avoid going to Portland as a general rule because of the bad traffic, bad roads, and bad parking.  When we do meet friends and family in portland, we surely avoid all of the areas known for homeless, beggars, etc.

"This ""reporting"" is horrid. Allow me to correct some of the glaring errors. First of all, the RRQZ advisory committee has mostly business interests represented, and most of those are from downtown, where only three crossings exist. There were also usually five to seven city staff members participating.

Secondly, the panel did not recommend the reconfiguration of the easternmost crossing. That was apparently a requirement from City Council, though I am taking city staff's word for that part (they may have created this ""requirement"" out of thin air). That reconfiguration is what is forcing the closure of a crossing since railroads are allowed to force crossings to close when they allow a new one to be built. 

Third, there was no final recommendation that the crossing that is closed be Lawrence.

I would add that the majority of the people who live near the crossings, the Whiteaker residents, do not find the horns to be particularly bothersome, by all accounts. Yes, I live there.",0,0,0.038786705869954904,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,993

"USO is an ETF that attempts to track the cost of WTI oil.  It's mostly geared for people who want to short term trade the movements in oil.  You would be better served looking at the actually price of a barrel of oil (approx. $34.30).  The price of oil fell from ~$147/barrel to ~$30 in 2008.

Star Wars, however, exists ""a long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away."" That opens SW up to potentially involve elements that would be too fantastical in a universe based on our own, no matter how futuristic. There are many other reasons, but fundamentally, comparing SW and ST does not seem like an appropriate comparison. (Also, if you insist on comparing them, it would probably be best to be done by someone with a reasonable degree of knowledge of both properties.)",0,0,0.04305173349247223,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1006

"Regarding Hales' aversion to favoritism, the article you link to explains,

*Reached by phone this week, Charlie Hales told the Tribune that First Stop won't get any favoritism.

""It's a budget decision like every other financial commitment for the following year that hasn't been made yet,"" he says. ""I don't know if we'll be contributing the city's contribution to that program or not.""

If the city does continue its funding support of First Stop, he says, he'd avoid any potential conflict of interest in the process by following the city charter guidelines, recusing himself from the vote.*

Both the present article and the linked WWeek article state that the City stopped funding First Stop when Hales took office, but I don't see any particular evidence for that statement. Rather, all I see is a promise by Hales to recuse himself from any decision regarding First Stop's funding, which doesn't seem to be invalidated by PDC's decision to continue supporting First Stop.

"Richard Corbeil might be interested to learn (if he's open to learning) that ALL long-distance phone calls within, to and from Alaska are subsidized per the federal Universal Service Fund law that requires ""equalization"" of rates.

Densely-populated urban areas in the contiguous U.S. cost much less to serve with phone or internet than, say, the sparsely-populated Navajo reservation in Arizona.

If, in my letter, I indicated that I agree with or believe the 2100 projections to be accurate, that would be an error on my part.

The fact that the majority of the scientist engaged in this and allied disciplines agree that mankind is a significant contributor to global warming, and what its projected effects will be, doesn't necessarily mean they're correct. There was a time not too long ago when the best medical practitioners, persons of science, didn't believe that blood circulated in the human body. The point being that there is always room for doubt.
The main point of my letter was that if sea levels begin to rise to the point where they begin to approach the 2100 predictions, it will happen slowly enough to allow people to adapt.

"Lawmakers should share in the pain they're putting off on Alaskans?
They should, but they won't.  Give up Legislator Salary Padding? No way! 

Legislators add thousands of tax-free dollars to $53,000 salaries by claiming ""reimbursement"" for lodging and meals at the federal per diem rate, rather than at the state per diem rate used by the governor and other state employees.  Legislators get about $235/day for lodging and food in Juneau, e.g. A recent House report shows that Rep. Reinbold paid $850 in rent plus $100 in utilities. Rep. Vasquez paid $650 in rent, plus $100 in utilities.. Both legislators received about $7,000 per month for room and board, meaning that each of them is receiving over $6,000 per month during the legislative session above actual lodging expenses. And Juneau reps gets 75% of the federal per diem rate, or about $175 per day- $5,000 per month of session- for living in their own homes.

"Awhile back SF invested millions in homeless services, transitional and long term housing, mental health and addiction counseling, health care, dental care, job skills training, placement and ongoing support, legal aid, case management, veterans services, access to computers and phones, every possible public benefit. After five years they studied how it all worked. What they found was very discouraging: the majority of homeless they served moved into the housing and used the services, but did not give up the street life. The transitional housing became occupied permanently by formerly undomiciled people who never became self supporting; never transitioned to somewhere more stable. They went home to their new apartments when they wanted to shower and sleep, went to the free Doctor or dentist when needed, but mostly they continued to spend all of their time back on the streets.

"A transgender person is one whose gender identity does not conform to expectations based on their assigned sex, and assigned sex is exactly that: how the delivering doctor described you based on inspection.  Some transgender persons do wish to undergo gender-affirmation surgery, some don't.  Gender identity is not a binary thing.  It's our culture that is set up that way, and conformance to gender stereotype is pretty much expected.  Also, gender-affirmation surgery is quite expensive, and until recently - and only if you have a job with great benefits - covered by insurance.  So the most that many transgender folks who want to transition can practically do is hormone treatments and of course social transition - presenting according to their gender identity. Hence the freakout.

So the issue here is really a very complicated one that requires a lot of discussion. And yes, greater use of gender-neutral or family restrooms with private stalls would. So too locker rooms...",0,0,0.4411576970392942,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,984

"Boozer Schmidt has an interesting commentary about freedoms to work, worth reading and considering.  The real issue is not the actual dollars, but the purchasing power.  In 1968 the minimum wage was raised to  $1.60, vs. $1.00 in early 1967.  In terms of current purchasing power, the value of that $1.60 wage would now be equal to $10.34.   Historically, that is 1968 minimum wage level was the highest ever, in terms of its actual purchasing power.  However, here's the point, and the record is clear: quite soon after the minimum wage is raised, there's an immediate surge in inflation, which works to erode the increase in purchasing power, even totally negate that bump in the dollar wage.  Economists can make a pretty good case that the huge inflation rates we began to see in the early 1970s were triggered by that 1968 bump in the minimum wage.  Inflation is a great enemy of wage earners.  It destroys purchasing power.

I suggest that those interested go to the above site and perhaps go to a few of the links. One only needs to do a search within google linking apartheid in South Africa and present day Israel to see what Mr. Weinerman is doing. Either Israel goes to one person, one vote as a single state, like the very brave South Africa, or it shrinks its soul daily with what destroys all apartheid countries. Zionism, by the very definition of Zionism, is a deliberate policy of racism so is anti-democracy.
Loving democracy and peace is not anti-Israel, not in the least. And loving apartheid isn't defending Israel, in the long run.

We no longer have a functioning multi-generational lifestyle.  Kids and parents, then, when they ""leave home"", it usually Kids (young men and women) spending their time with their ""age"" peers.

Forgiveness also unlocks unexpected doors, builds bridges across divides, broadens our awareness, and acts as a healing on the community itself; and does more to validate a life, in passing, than the kind of raw hostility I'm seeing surrounding this event.

We support jets dropping bombs on innocents described as collateral damage.  We support locking humans in cages for most of their lives for relatively minor property or non-violent ""sex"" crimes.  All of these instances reflect a profound disrespect for the sanctity people's lives.  When society as a whole teaches that people are disposable as a matter of convenience, it is not surprising in the least that individuals reach similar conclusions and are moved to kill.  As long as we as a society teach disrespect for life.  Killings will continue.",0,1,0.7485767778778758,0,0.4000000059604645,0.0,0.0,0.30000001192092896,0.30000001192092896,0.20000000298023224,0.0,999

"I think all the surprise and outrage here seems a little misplaced. Of course ticket scalping is a big problem, but at least the Aladdin Theater is attempting to crack down on it by comparing tickets and IDs at the door.

Anyway, I'm guessing these shows would have sold out in seconds regardless. We're talking about a comedian who regularly sells out venues 10 times as large as the Aladdin; is it so hard to believe that 2400 Portlanders were ready to buy tickets at 5 p.m. sharp?

"The article is only surprising in that I thought Will's partisanship was the equal of his ideology.    I may have got that wrong.   Will is showing he will not blindly accept anybody with a Republican label.  He even recognizes the compromise that Pres. Obama built into this nomination.  When both side squawk that Garland isn't liberal enough, or conservative enough, he's probably in a good spot to examine all data presented to him in court.

This nomination is classic Obama behavior, trying to find a middle ground with the opposition.    Republican leadership may soon look back on the Obama terms with fondness.

Throw in the mandates that have to be covered in Obamacare and you get expensive plans with high deductibles that are useless to most people in the first place. Health care reform should have been in shorter more concise laws that could be observed for a period of time and modified more easily. Instead we go got a monster that was written for the hospitals to take over medicine, protected big pharma, and was a wash for insurers.

Friend, unemployment is at historically low levels. EMPLOYMENT, the number of Americans actually working, has, under Obama, steadily climbing. 
Simply, there is no objective evidence that a social safety net discourages work. None, at all. 
Yes, raising the minimum wage may increase the cost of goods--- so feel free, as a consumer, not to buy them. But also know that for the hundreds of thousands that now have more wages, they will be increasing THEIR purchasing power. They, of course, will need less government assistance.

And they believe the entire burden of supporting a state government, that is grossly bloated from 35 years of free money, needs to fall on the private sector.

"Kafoury conveniently avoids pointing out the environmental cowardice of her former colleagues in the legislature.

Before and during the 2013-14 legislative session Oregon was facing the prospect of three major coal terminals. On February 5, 2013 Jules Bailey, Chairman of the House Energy and Environment Committee, was asked to introduce any type of coal bill* so that Oregonians could have an opportunity to speak out on the issue. Jules Bailey, Chairman of the House Energy and Environment Committee refused. The Sierra Club ignored Bailey’s recalcitrance. A shame on both their houses.

Bailey succumbed to pressure from a few pro-coal unions for a few jobs over protecting Oregon’s environment. The Sierra club let him off the hook. Reprehensible.

The Sierra Club endorsement of Bailey is severely tainted as are Jules Bailey’s so-called environmental credentials.

"Here's what's going to happen - Republicans will lose the White House. That's a given. If you haven't yet accepted that fact then kudos to the echo-chamber that continues to feed you false information. They're certainly succeeding in doing their job.

Republicans will also lose the senate. Democrats only need five seats to retake the majority. Given that Trump or Cruz is a disaster for the down ticket races PLUS Republican senators refusing to do their job, Democrats will have an easy time taking those five seats.

"Outsider:  Here's some more info for you. It's based on the Oregon Department of Employment's publication ""Oregon's Minimum Wage Jobs: Facxts, Figures and Context""
Facts:  100,000 minimum wage jobs out of 1.9 million  about 5%
              Total wages:  about 1% of total wages in the State
              
My conclusion: the Minimum wage increase will represent a .05% increase in the wages paid in Oregon.

The article's summary:

""On the whole, small to moderate increases in the minimum wage do not
appear to have sizeable negative effects on employment. Belman and
Wolfson note, “Employment effects are too modest to have meaningful
consequences for public policy in the dynamically changing U.S. labor
market.” There are so many moving pieces in the economy, so many
structural and cyclical changes causing constant churn, that moderate
increases to the minimum wage in the past have had effects “too small to
be statistically detectable in the meta-analysis.”

"I'm apparently not explaining clearly. Using a gun to wound is just as much using deadly force under the law as using it to kill. The intent in using deadly force, whether a gun or not, is to stop a threat. If the threat dies due to the application of deadly force so be it, that is a possible result, but not the intent. So, no, you aren't ""trying to kill"" you are trying to stop.

Since using a gun is using deadly force, no matter where you aim, to state you felt merely wounding was ""sufficient"" you are essentially admitting the threat you were facing didn't actually justify using the gun to stop it at all.

To be prescribing it and not to be aware of this is an error of exceptional proportions. It suggests that the prescriber is not adequately familiar with the medication. Tramadol is not a risk free medication. It has been known to cause seizures and induce delirium. Using it to treat opiate withdrawal is not medically supportable with the current information base. It is not approved for this purpose and there are no studies of adequate quality to justify its use in this way.
Additionally, having a provider with no DEA certification prescribing medications for the relief of  substance withdrawal is not acceptable practice. The medications used to treat alcohol withdrawal, in particular,  have ALWAYS required it.

"I do not agree with the Governor. I believe we need to cut the budget even further to what is sustainable. That is what an individual, family or business does when they have less revenue. A tax & spend policy is not the road to prosperity. I will never support an income tax & will vote against politicians who support it. The income tax is the most unfair tax of all methods of taxation. One only needs to look at the federal income tax & the IRS to see evidence of it. When almost one half of the country pays little or no income tax, that means the rest of us pay the bills. Why should anyone who pays little or no tax worry about the size of the budget? He will not vote for people who will work to keep expenses low.
The Founding Fathers of our country did not believe in a direct tax on individuals or property. They supported a consumption tax. Karl Marx supported an income tax in his Communist Manifesto.

A lot of student workers don't actually receive credit for work. I didn't despite my job being related to my degree.

In order to have a system that works, we have to have rational laws and a widely known process for checking up on these people. We don't seem to have that process, and I think part of the problem in developing one is the distrust between both sides of the gun ownership issue.

When this happened an area much larger than today's Alaska disappeared as sea level rose from all of the melted glacial ice.

We simply forgot that it ever happened at all and the Great Ice Age was only rediscovered in the 1850's.

what is being done to bring in additional revenue? The governor requested HB 252 to close loop holes in the cruise ship industry. This is estimated to bring in over 20 million a year. The legislature has done nothing on this bill. Instead they go after the easy targets. Since less than half of Alaska graduates even go to college taking away the scholarships was an easy decision.

"Correction: District 18 was scheduled to caucus in the balcony.  It was moved to the parking lot because there were too many people.  At that point, in the balcony, the Caucus Leader (the person running the caucus and counting the votes) started collecting the green voter cards from Hillary supporters and telling several of them they did not have to stay for their votes to count.  This was a mistake.  I do not think the Caucus Leader collected all the Hillary cards, but when she counted them, there were 86.  Bernie supporters rightfully objected to counting cards instead of ""bodies holding cards"" as the rules require.  The Caucus Leader then handed cards back to Hillary supporters and counted the 69 Hillary supporters that remained.  Both sides objected.  Hillary supporters asked for a count of the cards still in the Caucus Leader's hands, but never got it.  Eventually, a party person announced 86 votes and 4 delegates for Hillary.

Putting all those others aside for a moment, may I suggest that in today's economy, private sector affordable housing is virtually impossible.

Existing homes, unless you're talking a real ""dingbat"" are no cheaper.

Rentals are no cheaper.  They're premised on a) the cost of the apartments and b) the pool of renters.  There's, unfortunately very little available for minimum wage level working class families or, even, individuals.

Push polls are by definition, ""An opinion poll done with loaded questions or offering negative information to sway the opinions of those polled.""

"No, it really is the way you're writing about it.  

Some of the problems are just basic bad journalism, like relying on secondary sources, many of which lack credibility, like blogs and social media.  You don't seem to make much, if any, effort to follow up on these sources and make sure they're accurate or get different perspectives on incidents.

The primary issue with this piece is that you've created the appearance of an association between a white supremacist blog and the restaurant.

You never paid a dime for it, right? You get Permanent Funds Dividend checks each year for free from the oil industry, right? Why not support oil and gas?

The state got all these oil & gas lands for free and the oil industry paid to produce the oil and gas at no cost to the state. 

Then oil companies "" paid"" risk money to lease the minerals rights from the state! 

The oil industry found oil and gas then state got 12.5% royalty on 19 Billion barrels of oil and 8 Trillion cubic feet of gas for free!

Honestly I am tired of bailouts.  As a small businessman nobody bails me out if I fail.  I have to make fiscally responsible decisions in order to survive.  Our State Government has not done that and has sold it's soul.  If they use the Permanent Fund to bail themselves out I have 100% complete and utter confidence in them to spend themselves right back into this situation.  Seeing statewide waste of State funds that continues without checks and balances while hearing about threats on how to hammer the people of Alaska is disheartening.  If the State demonstrates an absolute commitment to skimming the poop off their cesspool of expenditures I am fine with a State Income Tax where individuals and corporations pay their share.  If the State satisfied the people with an absolute commitment and a strong future budget plan then I am sure the people would also be willing to allow a portion of the PFD for a one time expenditure to balance the budget.

The discovery of oil at Prudhoe Bay in 1968 and the 1973 Oil Crisis in response to the Yom Kippur War played a large role in Egan's second governorship, as demand for oil increasingly played a role in the state's politics.

"""moose roamed the North Slope, about 3,000 years ago"" 

I find that paraphrased statement and others regarding the historical environment quite interesting.  Most people will never give it a thought or that according to the USGS, ""horses and bison persisted on the North Slope until at least 12,500 years ago"".

Why is this interesting?  Because there had to be a climate which allowed the feed for these animals to grow 12,000 years ago!  Incidental evidence which shows to fanatics that the climate has changed before, without man's interference.  The same fanatics who have a mistaken impression that 'man' is in charge of this world.  Certainly on a limited basis, man's activities have an effect but in the big picture, the picture which includes the reality of our existence, man is no more than an annoying flea biting on the ass of an elephant.

"If Republicans have a rebuttal to Krugman, I'd like to read it. Claiming Democrats are just as bad, or that Krugman is an idiot does not count as a defense
Krugmans's claim that there are actions by Sanders supporters similar to what we have seen on the Right is correct. I have seen nasty comments from some who claim to be Sanders supporters. 
Krugman writes: ""...we’re starting to see hints..."" of a trend toward demagoguery on the Sanders side. But hints of a trend is hardly a long standing practice. Nor is it encouraged or even accepted by any but the most rabid Sanders supporters.
Each week a group of about 50 core Sanders supporters meet to discuss strategy and show encouragement.

But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future security.--Such has been the patient sufferance of these Colonies; and such is now the necessity which constrains them to alter their former Systems of Government. The history of the present King of Great Britain is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations, all having in direct object the establishment of an absolute Tyranny over these States. To prove this, let Facts be submitted to a candid world.

He has abdicated Government here, by declaring us out of his Protection and waging War against us.

"Group selectivity dictates we have in us a very strong urge to agree with one another and to identify as a group. The problem in politics is that your in a room with people who are supposed to be representatives of groups, not identifying as a group unto themselves and seeking to agree with one another. Our system is sabotaged by biology, and Oregons good-ole boy system of politicians caring more about ""being on board"" with one another is the problem not wheeler. 

Why?

Because reason begins with disagreement not agreement. Laws of physics are not things we prove, they are things we cannot disprove yet cannot observe without fail, i.e. we disprove everything we can and whatever is left is assumed to be ""truth"". Reason is a process of analytical deduction and it is the basis of pretty much anything which pretends to surpass the bias of our own subjective agreements, and the multiple failures it requires are responsible for every breakthrough....ever.

One obvious answer is what Girdwood did - agreed to tax itself to provide for the services that is needed.  The rest of MOA pays for Police Services, why don't the other communities.

Also, the employee at the theater was a bit negative towards the owners of the Broadway Metro in his comments regarding the split.  

I don't know any of the owners from either theater.  But, in the past,  I always enjoyed it when the owners worked the front at either location.  After seeing the pictures of the Broadway Metro owners, I see they are the owners who were always working at both locations, I guess the Broadway Metro is where I will be viewing the majority of my movies in the future.

Meaningful comparisons would comprise current male-female pay rates in the same profession at a similar time in career.  No data given.  The comparison with other countries fails to examine the percentage of females working.  Likely those who do not work outside the home are not included in computing the average wage.  If working women in some countries comprise mostly professionals, they will rank better compared to men.

Based on what is not said, I conclude that the pay ""disparity"" comes primarily from career choice rather than male-female pay differences in comparable jobs.

I understand from Imago Dei's position papers* that the church will not marry gay and lesbian couples or allow unrepentant gay and lesbians to hold leadership positions. I can't imagine joining a religious community, but celebrating marriage outside of the community.

"Carrie Downing-Larick Those of us who pay taxes pay for state-provided ""health care"" which includes, in this circumstance, abortion. Whether you agree or not, I consider abortion to be the murder of an unborn child. While we can debate whether society has the authority to prevent you from killing your unborn children, there should be no debate that you should not have the authority to force me to pay for it. The reason for that is simple and should be obvious to anyone -- I should not be forced to commit murder, not even indirectly through funding it. And that is what SB 89 is all about -- removing public funding from agencies that use ""women's health services"" as a euphemism for funding abortions.

"Even though it would hit me harder than the average Alaskan, I'm with you Clem.  A flat income tax on gross earnings (no loopholes or deductions).  But it's going to hurt.

Assuming the oil tax credits get cut and the budget gets another good trimming, maybe we're left with a $3 billion deficit. Alaska's median household brings in ~$70K for an average 2.7 people.

But subtract out the PFD that comes in, at ~$5,400 per average household, and the net cost is $4,600 per average household.  

My guess is that these numbers are high.  Would be interesting to see a more in-depth analysis.",0,0,0.19328272569693614,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,750

"Just want to say how nice it is to see reporting on this kind of community action. People working to make positive change, Commissioners listening and using their judgement, the RG letting me know not only what happened but why. 

It does bring worry to the mind, since, as Commissioner Bozievich said, at some point when the timber funds run out, Lane County is going to have to look for funding for many such projects. A strapped electorate won't vote for taxes, Lane County absolutely has to have certain funds in order to survive. 

It is obvious that Lane County needs to put a lot of effort into bringing a large company into the area, one that can actually pay taxes instead of apply for relief from them. Jobs are the answer to a lot of questions, including the massive homelessness problem. To transition from a timber receipts county to a strong county that has a lot of tax revenues and jobs from employment, that will take some real magic.

"Thank you Shannyn! Also to be considered here is the very obvious way in which this company was avoiding any local hire. The ""test"" would be a welding certification test which could be taken either in Anchorage or Fairbanks. The employer could very simply arrange for local employees to be tested by calling a lab in either location and telling them what procedure they wanted the welder to be certified for.

"Good expletive riddance.

Let's stop reflecting on the ""good old days"" (that weren't really all that great) and whining that outsiders moving to town are ruining it for all of us 'real' Portlanders. Portland was never all that cool, and it still isn't all that cool.

""Old Portland""-ers have a serious case of change-phobia. Portland seems like a pretty progressive place (when you totally ignore our disgustingly racist past and present), but Portlanders seem to turn ugly when progress makes them feel like outsiders in their own town. Wake up call: it's not your city, it never has been, and you enjoyed belonging to the culturally dominant group the last few decades due to sheer dumb luck and not some divine right to dictate the city's culture due to your nativity.

Cities all over the country are changing rapidly. Let's be thankful that we're changing more in the SF and Seattle direction of economic growth instead of in the Detroit direction.",0,1,0.631848079276642,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,953
"Pre-PFD we used to have a small income tax as a percent of our federal income tax, and we also had a larger percentage than now of rural subsistence residents who - then as now- had little paid work other than fishing and trapping.  It did not break us - nor would a small income tax now. 
Also it would capture income from rural residents and from non-residents who earn here on the Slope, in fishing  in tourism. 
The PFD could offset part of it.
We could add a  a three sunset renewal review attached to it, and we could include  a more aggressive offset of personal taxes by taking more from the more wasteful pieces of the exploration tax credits.

"Wow, what an interesting post.  I disapprove of many, likely most, illegal acts and am content to have our criminal justice system determine the guilt or innocence of those accused of crimes.  I wasn't particularly enthralled with the idea of driving over to the Malheur Refuge so the Bundy's and their buddies could point guns at me.  I haven't wet my pants in nearly 70 years and don't feel I'm particularly a coward.  However, I like to think I have enough common sense to avoid a confrontation with right-wing extremists with guns.  

I would, however, enjoy debating this issue face to face with you...preferably without guns.  I post under my real name.  Give me a call (I'm in the book) and let's get together for coffee or a bee and a civil discussion.  regards, Gary",0,0,0.4033530616735869,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,775

"As a teacher of color  who works at Harrison Park, I have to respectfully disagree with Emily Toll.  It is sad that teachers (mostly Caucasian) think they know what is best for minority students.  As a child, I had the experience of being in ESL classes for four years of my early education and had to miss electives, such as music, PE, and art. However, I would not trade what I learned in ESL for these enhancement classes.  These classes would not have helped me pass my exams in high school, the SAT, or getting a scholarship in college.  As I am able to converse in another language, I am able to talk to parents in their own language on a more personable level.  Most, if not all parents, expressed that they prefer to have their child(ren) in ESL.  This is the general consensus among minority parents in any language.  To say that John Walden did not solicit input from ESL parents is disrespectful and slanderous.

If AHFC and AIDEA can't put more of their principal to work on elderly housing, day care centers, rehab units, & small business loans, then it should give up some principal to the general fund where it can be used for such purposes with grants.
